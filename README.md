# Melanoma Detection using Transfer Learning with EfficientNet in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements transfer learning with EfficientNet in PyTorch to detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer, from high-resolution images of skin lesions. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models trained on large datasets to improve the performance of our model on a smaller dataset.

## Dataset
This meticulously curated dataset of 13,900 images serves as a valuable asset in propelling advancements in both dermatology and computer-aided diagnostics. Delve into the intricate domain of melanoma, where each pixel bears the promise of reshaping early detection methodologies.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Transfer Learning with EfficientNet
We use EfficientNet, a convolutional neural network architecture designed for efficient and effective transfer learning. EfficientNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks while being computationally efficient.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting melanoma from skin lesion images.

## Future Work
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explore other pre-trained models for transfer learning.
- Investigate data augmentation techniques to further improve model generalization.
