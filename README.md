# Melanoma Detection using Transfer Learning with EfficientNet in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements transfer learning with EfficientNet in PyTorch to detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer, from high-resolution images of skin lesions. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models trained on large datasets to improve the performance of our model on a smaller dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of high-resolution images of skin lesions, sourced from Kaggle or other relevant sources. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets for model training, validation, and evaluation, respectively.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Train the model using `python train.py`.
2. Fine-tune the model (optional) using `python finetune.py`.
3. Make predictions on new images using `python predict.py`.
4. Evaluate the model using `python evaluate.py`.

## Transfer Learning with EfficientNet
We use EfficientNet, a convolutional neural network architecture designed for efficient and effective transfer learning. EfficientNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks while being computationally efficient.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting melanoma from skin lesion images.

## Future Work
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explore other pre-trained models for transfer learning.
- Investigate data augmentation techniques to further improve model generalization.
